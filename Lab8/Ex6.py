#Debugging exercise # 6
# Write code that will iterate through numbers from 1 to 10 and print the number if 
# it is not equal to 5 (using continue) and stop the loop entirely and print a message 
# when it reaches 8 (using break).

for x in range(10):
    if x == 8:
        print("done!")
        break
    if x != 5:
        print(x)
        continue
